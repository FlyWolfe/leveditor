# LevEditor
Touch-based level editor.

This project was created with the intention to bring level editing to touch-enabled devices - to provide 2D game developers a reason to find productivity in tablets aside from the occasional doodle. It was also intended to explore and examine the possibility of game development tools being developed specifically for touch and/or mobile devices, and how we might be able to further utilize this rather recent but incredibly popular wave of technology.

There are too many ideas I have for this project that I want to toy with, so a few source files may be rather untouched. Please feel free to do whatever you'd like with this project. For those who are interested, my (initial) plan was to use file transfer to - after exporting the created level to a file - send the file to a desktop development machine where they could use a library to parse and add the file/level to their project.

This project's initial commit was from a development machine using Visual Studio and MonoGame that would deploy to the Surface Pro 3 (although any device set to a 3:2 aspect ratio should work just fine).
